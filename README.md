# Interactive-Form
JS Project 3

Project Overview

In this project, I used JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional Full Stack conference.

 The HTML and CSS files were supplied, I had to add my own JavaScript to make the form more user-friendly by:

--Adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity

--Validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.
